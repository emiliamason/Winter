# PressInCaseOfWinter
Assignment 3 - Press in Case of Winter
Project by Emilia Mason
Date: November 10th,2017

Press in Case of Winter is a project that offers a button for one to press when in need of tropical music and colors. 
I wanted to bring the tropics to a room as soon as someone comes in. 
Play happy/tropical music from Latin America and show bright colors.

The concept was inspired by two ideas: 
1. Beat the Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) or more commonly known as “winter blues” transforming my apartment in a tropical and colorful
paradise. Studies have shown happy and upbeat music has a positive effect on one’s mood.

2. An appropriation of Christmas. I had never thought of the fact that we use real and fake pines as christmas trees, decorated as if it is 
winter. Nicaragua is part of the southern hemisphere, December is the beginning of summer and temperatures oscillate between 
26 to 30 degrees during christmas season. I wanted to use a local tree for my christmas celebration. 

The idea is very simple:

When coming in the apartment press the button to warm up your mood. Pressing the button will start a random song from the songs and 
animation indicated in the P5.Js folder uploaded to Cyberduck.
